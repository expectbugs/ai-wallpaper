Once we have tested multiple methods of custom resolution at max quality and chosen the best method, we need to extract the expansion pipeline from anyspecific model, and make that into its own tool, that will take in an image of any resolution or aspect ratio and turn it into any output resolution and aspect ratio with no loss of quality.  That way any model can generate an image of any size and send it to the ultrascaler tool and get it remade to any target size.  This will.not only greatly simplify adding new models and updates to the project, but I can release the ultrascaler as a stand-alone project and use it for much more than just wallpapers.
