Prompt: Image Prompt:  *A lone, ethereal fox with glowing amber eyes stands atop a floating obsidian rock surrounded by swirling galaxies in the distance. The foreground is dominated by jagged crystal formations that refract light into prism-like colors, casting a soft glow over the scene. In the middle ground, a serene lake of liquid mercury mirrors the cosmic splendor above, with ripples distorting the stars like abstract brushstrokes. Bioluminescent algae float on its surface, emitting faint blue hues. The background features a dark, swirling void where time appears to warp and twist, revealing glimpses of ancient civilizations hidden within. The lighting is a mix of soft golden light from an unseen sun and the cold silver glow of distant stars, creating a stark contrast between warmth and chill. The atmosphere is simultaneously tranquil and ominous, with subtle whispers carried by the wind. The artistic style blends impressionism's soft blending with surrealism's fantastical elements and chiaroscuro's dramatic shadows, using deep purples, blues, golds, and silvers to evoke a sense of cosmic mystery. The composition emphasizes verticality, with the obsidian rock as the central anchor, surrounded by chaotic yet balanced elements. Textures range from the smooth, reflective surface of the mercury lake to the rough, jagged crystal formations, creating a tactile contrast. The mood is contemplative and otherworldly, hinting at hidden stories of cosmic exploration and forgotten realms.*  Keywords: Photorealistic, High Quality, 4K, Surreal, Fantasy, Cosmic, Bioluminescent, Liquid Metal, Floating Rock, Galaxy Swirls.
