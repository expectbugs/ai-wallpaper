This is a project that generates a beautiful, ultra-high quality 4K desktop background every morning using advanced supersampling techniques.

It retrieves the weather and a random theme or themes and then uses deepseek-r1:14b via ollama to come up with a unique image prompt tailored to the chosen image model, incorporating local weather theme and date contexts for a beautiful, sometimes surreal, imaginative, amazing background.

My hardware is as follows:

CPU: Core i7 13700KF
RAM: 32GB DDR4
GPU: NVidia RTX 3090 with 24GB VRAM
SSD: 4TB m.2 NVMe 4th gen
SSD2: 1TB m.2 NVMe 4th gen
HDD: 3TB 7200rpm HDD
Display:0.0 - Sony Bravia 55" 4k OLED TV

Remember, NO SILENT FAILURES.  All errors should be loud and proud.  Every part of every function should either work perfectly or the script should fail completely with verbose errors.  We must keep it as easy to fix as possible.

Also remember, it does not matter how long it takes, or how much space it uses, the only priority in this project is amazing, incredibly detailed, ultimate high quality images.
