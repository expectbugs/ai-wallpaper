# Implementation Status Tracker

## Purpose
Track what's actually implemented vs what's claimed in the megaplan to ensure accuracy.

## Current State (2025-07-20)

### Claimed Complete (but actually incomplete/wrong):
- [x] **AspectAdjuster** - ✅ REPLACED with progressive implementation (Phase 2)
- [x] **Pipeline order** - ✅ FIXED - Aspect adjustment now in Stage 1.5 before refinement (Phase 3)
- [x] **Resolution strategy** - ✅ Progressive outpainting logic added (Phase 1.1)
- [x] **Inpaint pipeline** - ✅ Now validates for proper inpaint pipeline (Phase 2)
- [x] **Fail-loud philosophy** - ✅ All fallbacks removed, loud errors only (Phase 2)

### Actually Complete:
- [x] **ConfigManager resolution loading** - Properly loads resolution.yaml
- [x] **HighQualityDownsampler** - Exists and works correctly
- [x] **Basic resolution management** - ResolutionManager exists with basic functionality
- [x] **Resolution presets** - Basic presets defined in code (PRESETS dictionary)
- [x] **SDXL model loading** - Base infrastructure works
- [x] **Weather integration** - Working correctly
- [x] **Theme system** - Working with 60+ themes
- [x] **Prompt generation** - DeepSeek integration working

### Not Yet Implemented:
- [x] **calculate_progressive_outpaint_strategy** method ✅ DONE (Phase 1.1)
- [x] **TiledRefiner** class for ultra-quality mode ✅ DONE (NoLimit implementation)
- [x] **Stage 1.5** in pipeline (aspect adjustment before refinement) ✅ DONE (Phase 3)
- [x] **Progressive outpainting** for extreme aspect ratios ✅ DONE (Phase 2)
- [x] **should_use_progressive_outpainting** method ✅ DONE (Phase 1.1)
- [x] **Adaptive blur/steps/guidance** based on expansion ratio ✅ DONE (Phase 2)
- [x] **Multi-pass tiled refinement** ✅ DONE (NoLimit implementation)
- [ ] **New resolution.yaml** with all quality settings
- [x] **_needs_aspect_adjustment** method in SDXL model ✅ DONE (Phase 3)
- [x] **_create_inpaint_pipeline** method ✅ DONE (Phase 3)
- [x] **_refine_stage2_full** method ✅ DONE (Phase 3)
- [x] **_upscale_stage3_simple** method ✅ DONE (Phase 3)
- [x] **_ensure_exact_size** method ✅ DONE (Phase 3)
- [x] **_tiled_ultra_refine** method ✅ DONE (Phase 3)

### Pipeline Order Issues:
**Old (WRONG)**: Generate → Refine → Aspect Adjust → Upscale
**New (CORRECT)**: Generate → Aspect Adjust → Refine → Upscale ✅ FIXED (Phase 3)

## Next Steps
1. ✅ Complete Phase 0: Prerequisites (DONE)
2. ✅ Complete Phase 1: Core Infrastructure Updates (DONE)
3. ✅ Complete Phase 2: Progressive Outpainting System (DONE)
4. ✅ Complete Phase 3: Pipeline Reordering (DONE)
5. Complete Phase 4: Tiled Refinement (TiledRefiner class)
6. Complete Phase 5: Configuration Update (new resolution.yaml)
7. Complete Phase 6: Final Integration

## Notes
- All new methods must fail loud with no silent fallbacks
- Quality is the only metric - time and resources are irrelevant
- Test extreme cases (e.g., 7680x1080 mega-ultrawide) before marking complete
