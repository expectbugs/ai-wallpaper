# Implementation Status Tracker

## Purpose
Track what's actually implemented vs what's claimed to ensure accuracy.

## Current State (2025-07-21 - v4.5.4)

### Claimed Complete (but actually incomplete/wrong):
- [x] **AspectAdjuster** - ✅ REPLACED with progressive implementation (Phase 2)
- [x] **Pipeline order** - ✅ FIXED - Aspect adjustment now in Stage 1.5 before refinement (Phase 3)
- [x] **Resolution strategy** - ✅ Progressive outpainting logic added (Phase 1.1)
- [x] **Inpaint pipeline** - ✅ Now validates for proper inpaint pipeline (Phase 2)
- [x] **Fail-loud philosophy** - ✅ All fallbacks removed, loud errors only (Phase 2)

### Actually Complete:
- [x] **ConfigManager resolution loading** - Properly loads resolution.yaml
- [x] **HighQualityDownsampler** - Exists and works correctly
- [x] **Basic resolution management** - ResolutionManager exists with basic functionality
- [x] **Resolution presets** - Basic presets defined in code (PRESETS dictionary)
- [x] **SDXL model loading** - Base infrastructure works
- [x] **Weather integration** - Working correctly
- [x] **Theme system** - Working with 60+ themes
- [x] **Prompt generation** - DeepSeek integration working

### SWPO Implementation (v4.5.4):
- [x] **Sliding Window Progressive Outpainting** - ✅ COMPLETE
- [x] **calculate_sliding_window_strategy** method - ✅ DONE
- [x] **_sliding_window_adjust** method - ✅ DONE
- [x] **_execute_sliding_window** method - ✅ DONE
- [x] **8-pixel rounding for SDXL compatibility** - ✅ DONE
- [x] **CLI integration (--swpo, --window-size, --overlap-ratio)** - ✅ DONE
- [x] **Final unification pass** - ✅ DONE
- [x] **CUDA cache management** - ✅ DONE
- [x] **Stage saving support** - ✅ DONE

### Previously Implemented:
- [x] **calculate_progressive_outpaint_strategy** method
- [x] **TiledRefiner** class for ultra-quality mode
- [x] **Stage 1.5** in pipeline (aspect adjustment before refinement)
- [x] **Progressive outpainting** for extreme aspect ratios
- [x] **should_use_progressive_outpainting** method
- [x] **Adaptive blur/steps/guidance** based on expansion ratio
- [x] **Multi-pass tiled refinement**
- [x] **_needs_aspect_adjustment** method in SDXL model
- [x] **_create_inpaint_pipeline** method
- [x] **_refine_stage2_full** method
- [x] **_upscale_stage3_simple** method
- [x] **_ensure_exact_size** method
- [x] **_tiled_ultra_refine** method

### Pipeline Order Issues:
**Old (WRONG)**: Generate → Refine → Aspect Adjust → Upscale
**New (CORRECT)**: Generate → Aspect Adjust → Refine → Upscale ✅ FIXED (Phase 3)

## Recent Updates (v4.5.4)
1. ✅ SWPO Implementation - Complete sliding window system
2. ✅ Tilde Path Fix - Fixed ~/ai-wallpaper path expansion issues
3. ✅ Error Handling - Fixed ConfigManager and dimension rounding errors
4. ✅ Documentation - Updated all docs to v4.5.4

## Notes
- All methods follow fail-loud philosophy with no silent fallbacks
- Quality is the primary metric - time and resources are secondary
- SWPO enables extreme aspect ratios (e.g., 21600x2160) with seamless results
- All dimensions are rounded to multiples of 8 for SDXL compatibility
