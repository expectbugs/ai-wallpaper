REMEMBER:

Do a thorough, comprehensive code review.  Find any and ALL issues and problems and potential problems.  Focus on things like consistency and fallbacks and "graceful degradation" that might compromise the quality settings, but also catch everything else possible.  Be very thorough, use more than one source.

Implement SD3.5 Large, but don't use the same pipeline as SDXL.  Try a different approach, where (for expansion) you generate 1024x1024 tiles with a coherant overview of the big picture to create as close to the target resolution as possible but in one big fully-detailed coherant image with no seams or indication it was make piecemeal.  img2img refinement passes can help if needed.

Do a thorough code review, find all problems and solve them.

Do another thorough code review, a full level 1 diagnostic.  Focus on compatability between systems and OSes and different video cards and such.

Make sure to fix the FLUX pipeline.  Make the other models use the adaptive resolution pipeline, whichever one (SDXL vs SD3.5) works out the best for quality.

Collect more LoRAs, very modern ones, especially for SD 3.5 - can really be a gamechanger.

Test the different quality settings and tweak them so they are significantly faster.

Test running purely off CPU for different generation types with no loss of quality, just time.

Test other edge cases including tiny images.

Update all documentation and the -h argument in the CLI command.

FUTURE:

Build a GUI that makes all the power and features of the program much easier to visualize and use.

Structure it more like an all-encompassing image engine, because at this point that is more accurate.

Change the name to something more appropriate for this level of image generation system.
